Solar What?! is the outcome of ongoing research at the University of Edinburgh.

The product design process has taken place over three continents, with input from solar technicians, end users and energy access practitioners.

In 2017 over 6 million small, solar powered lighting devices were sold worldwide and 1.6 million solar powered lighting devices entered electronic waste flows.

We believe that delivering affordable, clean energy for all can also promote responsible production and consumption.

Our goal is to advocate for sustainable design in the global solar industry and promote the repair, reuse and recycling of solar powered electronics. We are pro-solar, anti-waste.

The Solar What?! Power is one of two products we have designed to champion our research and catalyse discussion around sustainability and repairability in the off-grid solar sector. The repository for our other product, the Solar What Power, can be found [here](https://github.com/SolarWhat/Light-SW2001 "here").

We encourage you to download the files, reproduce the products, make edits, suggest improvements and, most importantly, share your ideas around design for sustainable international development.  

More information about the project and the team behind it can be found on our [website](http://www.solarwhat.xyz/index.php "website").
